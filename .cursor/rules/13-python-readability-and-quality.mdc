# Readability and Quality

- Prioritize readable code over clever or compressed constructs.
- Use descriptive names, small focused functions, and straightforward control flow.
- Add type hints for public functions and module interfaces.
- Add concise docstrings when behavior is non-obvious.
- Prefer composition and clear module boundaries over tightly coupled code.
