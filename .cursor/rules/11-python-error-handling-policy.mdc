# Python Error Handling Policy

- Prefer fail-fast behavior by default; avoid broad `try/except` blocks.
- Only catch exceptions at clear boundaries (CLI UX, external I/O, network calls, or input parsing).
- Never use empty `except` blocks and never swallow errors silently.
- If an exception is caught, add context and re-raise unless there is a clear recovery path.
- Do not use exceptions for normal control flow.
