# Core Rules

- Prioritize convention, clarity, and reproducibility over one-off shortcuts.
- Keep implementation code under `src/${package_name}/` and keep command-line entrypoints thin and orchestration-focused.
- Prefer explicit, readable, and deterministic code paths over implicit behavior.
- Keep changes minimal and scoped; avoid broad refactors unless explicitly requested.
- Preserve data and generated assets by default; avoid destructive operations unless explicitly requested and scoped.
