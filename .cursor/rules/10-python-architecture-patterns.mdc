# Python Architecture Patterns

- For each pipeline module, define a contract with `abc.ABC` and `@abstractmethod`.
- Use the Strategy Pattern for interchangeable implementations of the same behavior.
- Use Factory Method to construct or select the concrete strategy based on runtime config.
- Keep CLI commands separate from domain logic; commands trigger orchestration only.
- Favor dependency injection and pure inputs/outputs to keep strategies testable.
