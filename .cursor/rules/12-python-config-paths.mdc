# Config and Paths

- Keep project-wide constants and canonical paths in `src/${package_name}/config.py`.
- Use `pathlib.Path` exclusively for path composition, traversal, and normalization.
- Build paths relative to a deterministic project root constant.
- Keep environment-specific values isolated from code defaults.
- Avoid scattering hard-coded paths across modules.
